# Shrink Compact Sidebar

The new redesign for the sidebar made it very large, which can be annoying in many configurations.

This theme shrinks the compact mode collapsed sidebar back to its pre-1.13b sizing.

Do note that this will break when folders are released! I will try to find a solution for that when they do.
